# Unofficial GIT Code::Blocks repo that contains the following:

- New build documentation
- Batch/Script files to simplify building
- Updated NSIS installer
- Allot of third party plugins
- Major changes to help Windows developers
- Can now use Linux C::B to debug C::B like Windows allot easier
- MacOS C::B can build C::B 


Unfortunately C::B for MacOS cannot debug C::B due to OSX issues with GDB security
